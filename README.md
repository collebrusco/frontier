## Client Download
Click the green "Code <>" button towards the top right. Download as ZIP. Unzip the file to find a folder named frontier-main or similar.    
    
To make this as simple as possible, simply re-name this folder to '.minecraft' and put it in `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\` (which is where your .minecraft already is, back it up if you care. you can get here by hitting the windows key and typing `%appdata%`).

Run the launcher once, sign in, the forge 1.20.1 installation should be there. Lmk if not

### Warning:
there are **20 GB** of RAM allocated by default. adjust that if you don't have 32 lmk I can help w that

Enjoy!
