## Client Download
Installer coming soon. For now,     
Click the green "<> Code" button towards the top right. Download as ZIP. Extract the folder, you'll find a folder labeled 'frontier-main' or similar full of everything listed above. This is your new `.minecraft` folder. Back up or delete your old one, re-name this one, put it in the same place. Done.  
Optionally you could just drag all of the contents out of the zip into your existing `.minecraft`.
    
Recall that your `.minecraft` folder should go here: `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\` you can get here by hitting the windows key and typing `%appdata%`.

So after placing your new .minecraft in Roaming, run the launcher once, sign in, the forge 1.20.1 installation should be there. Lmk if not

### Warning:
there are **20 GB** of RAM allocated by default. adjust that if you don't have 32 lmk I can help w that it's in the installation settings in the MC launcher

Enjoy!

### Disclaimer
This repo is intended to hold a java minecraft 1.20.1 client with forge installed along with a bunch of specific mods, shaders, settings, and a few more things. I AM NOT the creator of anything included here (other than the compilation) and all rights are reserved by each respective creator / owner. This is just for my friends and I to quickly setup a client for our server on any windows pc with minecraft, and importantly **a real minecraft account is required even after downloading this pack** just as you'd expect.
