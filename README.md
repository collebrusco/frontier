## Client Download
Click the green "<> Code" button towards the top right. Download as ZIP. Unzip the file to find a folder named frontier-main or similar.    
    
To make this as simple as possible, simply re-name this folder to '.minecraft' and put it in `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\` (which is where your .minecraft already is, back it up if you care. you can get here by hitting the windows key and typing `%appdata%`).

Run the launcher once, sign in, the forge 1.20.1 installation should be there. Lmk if not

### Warning:
there are **20 GB** of RAM allocated by default. adjust that if you don't have 32 lmk I can help w that

Enjoy!

### Disclaimer
This repo is intended to hold a java minecraft 1.20.1 client with forge installed along with a bunch of specific mods, shaders, settings, and a few more things. I AM NOT the creator of anything included here (other than the compilation) and all rights are reserved by each respective creator / owner. This is just for my friends and I to quickly setup a client for our server on any windows pc with minecraft, and importantly **a real minecraft account is required even after downloading this pack** just as you'd expect.
